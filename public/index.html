     1. remove type="text/babel" from the script. What happens when you load index.html?
     Can you explain why? put back type="text/babel" but remove the Babel JavaScript library.
     What happens now?

     A. Removing type='text/babel' causes unexpected token '<'.
     Without this, the contents in the script is treated as regular javascript and
     and JSX is not valid javscript, so syntax error.

     A. Removing Babel Javascript Library causes the script to be ignored since the browser
     will not recognize scripts of type 'text/babel'

<!--
     2. We used the minified version of Babel, but not for react and reactdoM.
     Can you guess why? Switch to the production minified version and introduce a runtime
     error in react (check out the unpkg.com website for the names of the production
     versions of these libraries). For example, introduce a typo in the Id of the content
     node so there is no place to mount the component. What happens?

     A. react-dom.production.min.js:12 Uncaught Invariant Violation: Minified React error #200; 

     minified not useful for dev. There is less information about errors on production minified
     versions.
